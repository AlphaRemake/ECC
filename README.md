# Entity Class Compiler

This is the source code of an Entity Class Compiler (ECC), which is a custom build tool used to compile entity source files (`.es`) for Serious Engine 1.
It includes new features for classic engine versions (1.05 and 1.07) and also supports other engine versions, such as 1.50 and even Serious Sam Revolution.

Original source code is taken from [Serious Engine 1.10](https://github.com/Croteam-official/Serious-Engine).

Compiled executables are compatible with any version of Serious Engine 1.

## Building

This project can be built using any Microsoft Visual Studio starting with 6.0 (`C++98`). The project files are created for Visual Studio 2010 and newer.

If you want to build ECC for [Serious Engine 1 Mod SDK](https://github.com/DreamyCecil/SE1-ModSDK), select the `ClassicsEnhanced` configuration, which is designed to be used specifically with that SDK.
